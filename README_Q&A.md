# üß† Interview Questions and Answers on Posture Detection Project

## üìå General Understanding
**1. Can you briefly describe your project and its main objective?**  
The project aims to detect improper sitting posture using MediaPipe Pose and OpenCV. It captures real-time video, identifies body landmarks, calculates posture angles, and gives feedback like ‚Äúyou are too close to the screen.‚Äù

**2. What problem does your solution aim to solve?**  
It targets digital health by monitoring poor sitting habits to reduce posture-related issues such as back pain and eye strain.

**3. What tools and libraries did you use, and why?**  
- **MediaPipe**: For pose estimation and landmark detection.  
- **OpenCV**: For video capture, frame processing, and UI display.  
- **NumPy**: For geometric and vector calculations.

## üéØ MediaPipe Specific
**4. What is MediaPipe and which module did you use for posture estimation?**  
MediaPipe is a cross-platform framework by Google for building pipelines to process perceptual data. We used the **Pose module** to detect body landmarks.

**5. What are pose landmarks and how does MediaPipe identify them?**  
Pose landmarks are key body points (like shoulder, hip, ear). MediaPipe detects them using a deep learning model trained on annotated pose datasets.

**6. Explain the difference between `pose_landmarks` and `pose_world_landmarks`.**  
- `pose_landmarks`: 2D landmarks in the image space.  
- `pose_world_landmarks`: 3D landmarks in metric space relative to the camera.

**7. What are some challenges of using MediaPipe Pose in real-time video feeds?**  
- Inconsistent detection under low light.  
- Latency in processing.  
- Handling occluded or partially visible bodies.

## üõ† OpenCV Integration
**8. How did you use OpenCV to capture images from the webcam?**  
Using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` to initialize the webcam and read frames in a loop.

**9. How do you save captured frames using OpenCV?**  
By using `cv2.imwrite("filename.jpg", frame)`.

**10. How does `cv2.imshow()` behave in Jupyter Notebooks vs standalone scripts?**  
In Jupyter, it may not render properly; standalone scripts render windows better. Jupyter users often use `IPython.display`.

**11. Why did you encode the frame with `cv2.imencode()`?**  
To convert the frame into byte format for rendering in Jupyter Notebook or transmitting over network APIs.

## üßÆ Mathematical Logic
**12. How do you calculate angles between landmarks in your project?**  
Using the cosine rule or dot product on 2D/3D coordinates between joints.

**13. What is the use of the `findAngle()` function, and how does it work?**  
It calculates the angle between three points (e.g., shoulder-elbow-wrist) to analyze joint posture.

**14. How did you decide the threshold for ‚Äúbeing too close to the screen‚Äù?**  
By calculating the pixel distance between left and right shoulders. A low value implies closeness.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality
**15. How do you detect whether a person is sitting too close to the camera?**  
By measuring the horizontal distance between shoulders; a smaller distance indicates the user is closer to the camera.

**16. How do you display alerts like ‚ÄúYou are too close to the screen‚Äù?**  
Using `cv2.putText()` to overlay the warning on the frame.

**17. What parameters do you track for posture quality (e.g., neck, bend, shoulder inclination)?**  
- Neck angle  
- Back bend (shoulder-hip alignment)  
- Shoulder alignment angle

## üñº Image & Landmark Visualization
**18. How did you draw landmarks and connections using MediaPipe‚Äôs drawing utilities?**  
Using `mp_drawing.draw_landmarks()` with landmark list and connection pairs.

**19. What does `mp_drawing.plot_landmarks()` do?**  
It provides a 3D interactive plot of the landmarks using matplotlib.

**20. How do you ensure that landmarks are drawn only when valid data is available?**  
Using conditional checks like `if results.pose_landmarks:` before drawing.

## üìÅ File Handling
**21. How do you load multiple images from a folder using OpenCV?**  
Using Python‚Äôs `os.listdir()` to iterate filenames and load via `cv2.imread()`.

**22. What error-handling mechanisms did you use for reading or processing files?**  
Using `try-except` blocks and checking `if image is not None` before processing.

## üîç Optimization & Improvements
**23. How would you improve the accuracy of your posture analysis?**  
- Use moving average or smoothing for landmarks.  
- Calibrate angles for individual users.  
- Apply pose classification model.

**24. What changes would you make to deploy this in real-time for posture correction alerts?**  
- Package into a GUI app with auto-start.  
- Use threading to reduce UI lag.  
- Integrate sound notifications.

**25. How could you integrate this with a desktop app or mobile application?**  
Use frameworks like **PyQt/Flask/Streamlit** for desktop and **TFLite** with Flutter/Kivy for mobile apps.

## üß™ Bonus (Testing & Edge Cases)
**26. How do you handle missing or incorrect landmarks in MediaPipe?**  
By checking confidence values and skipping frames with low detection accuracy.

**27. What happens when the user moves suddenly or is partially out of frame?**  
The model might lose tracking or detect incorrect poses. A stability check or smoothing can help.

**28. Did you try using `static_image_mode=True` vs `False`? What difference did it make?**  
Yes. `True` processes one image at a time (better for debugging), while `False` is optimized for real-time video tracking.
